    <p>The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone. If<br>
       the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group<br>
       milworm didn't convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka<br>
       jdavis_a, a resident of <font color="blue">www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</font> homestead community<br>
       on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using<br>
       your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the<br>

    <font color="red">
     <p>Formula:<br>
    </font>
       (a-b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup><br>
       C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub></p>

       exactly 108 working passwords (and growing daily), <I>36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet<br>
       and 23 online passwords.</I></p>
